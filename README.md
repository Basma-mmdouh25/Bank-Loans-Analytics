# 📊 Bank Loan Analysis – Power BI Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of the bank’s loan portfolio, focusing on performance evaluation, risk exposure, branch efficiency, and operational optimization.

The solution transforms raw banking data into actionable insights to support strategic decision-making and credit policy improvement.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this analysis are:

- Evaluate overall loan portfolio performance  
- Monitor loan approval and rejection trends  
- Analyze branch-level acceptance efficiency  
- Measure financial exposure (Requested vs Approved amounts)  
- Understand loan distribution by type and gender  
- Identify operational bottlenecks (response time, tenure patterns)  
- Support data-driven credit policy optimization  

---

## 📊 Key Insights

### 🔎 Portfolio Health

- **Acceptance Rate:** 54.6% (Moderate credit selectivity)  
- **Total Requested Amount:** 331M  
- **Total Approved Amount:** 38.61M  
- Significant gap between requested and approved amounts indicates strict credit filtering and conservative lending strategy.

---

### 🔎 Branch Performance

- Some branches achieve **approval rates above 60%**, demonstrating strong credit evaluation efficiency.  
- Underperforming branches operate near **50% approval rates**.  
- Performance variability suggests the need for standardized credit assessment frameworks across branches.

---

### 🔎 Loan Type Performance

- **Business Loans** and **Personal Loans** dominate overall loan volume.  
- **Home Loans** show lower approval rates and lower contribution to total approved amounts.  
- **Education Loans** maintain stable but moderate performance levels.

---

### 🔎 Gender Distribution

- Male borrowers represent the majority of approved loans.  
- This presents an opportunity to evaluate female borrower inclusion strategies and improve demographic balance within the portfolio.

---

### 🔎 Operational Efficiency

- **Average Response Time:** 5 days (Operationally efficient process).  
- **Average Tenure:** 37 months, indicating a medium-term lending strategy aligned with risk-managed growth.

## 💡 Recommendations

### 1️⃣ Optimize Credit Policy by Branch
Standardize risk evaluation frameworks across branches to reduce approval rate discrepancies and ensure consistent lending quality.

### 2️⃣ Analyze Rejection Drivers
Conduct deeper analysis of key rejection factors, including:
- Income level  
- Credit score  
- Loan tenure  
- Loan type  

This will improve transparency and strengthen credit policy decisions.

### 3️⃣ Improve High-Value Loan Segments
Expand Business and Personal Loan strategies while maintaining strong risk controls to increase revenue contribution.

### 4️⃣ Increase Financial Inclusion
Develop targeted programs to enhance female borrower participation and achieve better portfolio diversification.

### 5️⃣ Enhance Risk Forecasting
Implement predictive analytics models such as:
- Probability of Default (PD)  
- Risk scoring by customer segment  
- Early warning risk indicators  

### 6️⃣ Reduce the Approval Gap
Analyze the discrepancy between requested and approved amounts to optimize capital allocation and improve funding efficiency.
